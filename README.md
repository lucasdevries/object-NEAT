* <del> Save best fit individual
* Find a better way to document all results
* Implement a better visualization to use for all results
* Find out which samples (pos/neg) are the most problematic
* Decrease number of inputs - 50?
* Use different convolutional filters
* Use normal (wide angle) images
* Use soft max layer?
* Change path checkpoints and add .gitignore
